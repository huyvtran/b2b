Hi Praveen , today you have 2 APK 
1. B2b_v0.9.2   - this will work only with Oth2 security - which is the current state of server - so first run all the test over this with Ravinder.

after completion of all test , request server team to enable OAM security and run 
2. APK   — browserTest.apk   - this will show a browser login page .
just check that , and preserve the log from Chrome /dev tools / inspect device.
